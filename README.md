# Candidate Technical Assessment

In this technical assessment, you need to build a flutter application based
on the storyline below.
Your application must have the following:
1. Display a list of 5 random contacts that is sorted based on the time. The time should be
displayed in the format of “time ago” like 1 minute ago or 1 hour ago. The sorting should
start from the most recent till the oldest time.
2. Users must be able to pull-to-refresh to generate another set of random contacts data
and append the latest information retrieved to the current list and sort based on
time-format.
3. The app continues to load the remaining contacts as the user scrolls down the list and
displays a message to inform the user that he/she has reached the end of the list.
4. The user can choose whether to receive notifications or otherwise by enabling or
disabling the feature with a toggle option
5. An action button that can allow the user to share the contact information to other
installed applications on the mobile.
Requirements:
1. Develop the APP using Flutter
2. Each completed storyline is a plus.
3. Track progress of the project via Git version control system.
4. List down all the plugins that you used to build the app.
